#### I continuously believed that <u>an artificial life</u> can be a performer and a part of an art installation in media arts

Trialogue was a big team-based work led by Zune Lee (BTW, I am Jun (Ki) Lee) to make three participants, a live fish, a human, and an artificial life, perform together in one stage. An art director, a composer, software engineers, an interface designer, and a hardware specialist took participated in this project. I, particulary as a software engineer, designed a simple AI engine for the artificial character 'Vau'. During the beginning of design of this project, I suggested to make an artificial life and a real fish participate in this project instead of just two who were a human and a machine. Moreover, I wanted to add emotions instead of just reacting to stimuli. However, due to lack of knowledge and understanding in human emotion, I was not successful enough to embed true emotions in this project.

 - Programmed an interface program between the human interface and the 3D engine.
 - Tried to embed emotions in the created artificial life, 'Vau'.
 - Used Visual Studio 6.0 in Window Platform.
