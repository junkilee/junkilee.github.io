</div>

The main objective for the project was originally designing a serial communication module with FPGA.

 - Was a team project with a teammate.
 - Designed a simple MIPS-like CPU and its instruction set.
 - Programmed an assembler for the designed instruction set.
 - Used rewritable ROM to store the data.
 - Was able to echo the serial communication with a PC.
 - Used polling mechanism to read inputs from the serial controller.


#### Dance Dance Revolution with LCD arrays (Logic Design Lab, 2000)

 - Was an interactive game on a circuit board.
 - Used 5x10 LCD arrays to display game board.
 - Used five push-button switches as an input method.
 - Used VHDL with ABEL language.
 - Used 64Kb ROM to store the game data.
