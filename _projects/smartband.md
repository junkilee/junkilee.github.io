As motions sesnors become smaller and less expensive with MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) technology, personal electronic devices are now equipped with a variety of motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyrometers. The application areas include measurement in sports activities, cellphones, and GPS devices. For example, Nike plus tracks your time, distance, pace, and calories as you run or walk.
As a measurement tool for sports activities, Smartband aims to measure repetitive exercises people do daily. Such exercises include push-ups, sit-ups, dumbbell lifting, and other gym exercises. Smartband uses a three-axis accelerometer to measure angular differences in a wrist and an upper arm joints to count those exercises.
