Liquid Media (a.k.a. Ripple of emotion) was an interactive instrument which manipulates not only the sound but images. It was like playing a piano in front of a pond which rippled in accordance with the keys that the player had touched. We installed a beam projector which was facing toward the ground. It was reflected through the water pool we installed in between the ground and the beam projector. Two robot arms on each side of the pool moved in relation with the touched keynotes. They made ripples on the surface of the water pool. I programmed an interface between MIDI keyboard and the robot arms.

 - Was a new type of an instrument which plays not only sounds but also images.
 - Programmed an interface between a MIDI keyboard and robot arms.
 - Used Visual Studio 6.0 in Window Platform.
