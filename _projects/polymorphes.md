Polymorphes was my first media art installation that I took participated in. It was a synthesis of both images and sounds with a simulataneous interaction with a machine. In a box shaped room, an audience can move in order to change the images in the facing screen and the sounds that came out from speakers. I programmed an interface between camera and images. Also, I programmed a music player which played short sound clips based on the audience's location. Wave clips were played and stoped whenever an audience enters certain areas.

 - Was a new type of an art installation which has not only images but sounds.
 - Programmed a music player which played sound clips in accordance with the audiences movement.
 - Used Visual Studio 6.0 in Window Platform with Direct X for the sound mixing.
