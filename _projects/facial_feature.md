This study explores how human social response toward the robot can change when we vary the number of the active degrees of freedom in the robot's head and face area. We investigate this problem by conducting two user studies that situate a person in a dialogue where the puppeteered robot asks personal questions. We compared the robot with varying degrees of freedom in the robot's neck and face area with the elderly population. The study was conducted in five different senior centers around the Greater Boston Area.
