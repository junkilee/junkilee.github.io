I just completed my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Brown University where I was advised under <a href="https://www.littmania.com/">Prof. Michael L. Littman</a>. My research focuses are in <b>reinforcement learning especially in its explainability, machine learning, robotics, and humand robot interaction (HRI)</b>.

Previously, I finished my Master's in the Media Arts and Sciences at MIT Media Lab. I worked at the <a href="https://robots.media.mit.edu">Personal Robots Group</a> led by <a href="https://cynthiabreazeal.media.mit.edu/">Prof. Cynthia L. Breazeal</a>.
I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University.
